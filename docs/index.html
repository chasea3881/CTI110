    <h1>Boston Terrier the Breed</h1>
    <p>Hi! My name is Adriana Chase and I made this website to share what I’ve learned about Boston Terriers.</p>
    <p>Boston Terriers are my favorite kind of dog. They’re sweet, playful, and great for all kinds of people.</p>
    <p>The cost of getting a Boston Terrier can range from $600 to $1,200 depending on where you look.</p>
